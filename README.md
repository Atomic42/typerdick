=========

A dickishly hard typing game.

#Things to do:

* Make it not use display: inline-block to put the columns side-by-side
 * Replace with absolute positioning using percentages. Bonus: allows any size of grid
* Create controls to adjust the speed and grid size and stuff
* Create a structure that represents the game internally and is easily queryable... a.k.a. stop using HTML for state :p
